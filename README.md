# Fashion_MNIST_Classification
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset which contains 70,000 images of various apparel types such as tshirt, trouser, shirt, handbag, shoes etc. In this project I have performed multiclass classification on this dataset using SVM + HOG and was able to classify images from the test set consisting of 10,000 images with 88% accuracy. Using only SVM I got about 83% accuracy, adding HOG increased the accuracy by about 5%. This project is been completely implemented from scratch in python using numpy and pandas.
